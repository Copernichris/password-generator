# Password Generator
This generator takes user input after the generate password button is pressed. A user selects the length and types of characters through a series of prompts then returns it to the screen for the user to see and copy.

## User validation
When a user enters a number less than 8, more than 128, or something that is not a number at all, a while loop brings up a new prompt that will continue until input is correct format

If a user selects none of the following parameters, an alert states at least one must be chosen. The function returns a blank string and the process must start from the begining.
